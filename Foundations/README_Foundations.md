# Foundations

This directory contains the formal theoretical basis of the Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET), including derivations, analytic models, and symbolic frameworks. See subfolders for specific modules:

- **Density/**: Elastic density scaling models and operators.
- **Tension/**: Brane rigidity functions and causal decoupling.
- **Operators/**: Visualization and interpretation of causal ($D$) and conformal ($D'$) derivatives.
- **Redshift_Drift/**: Frequency shift tests in low-density environments.
- **Isotropy/**: Framework for emergent isotropy from causal saturation.

Each component contributes to the mathematical structure of CET and supports future extensions to cosmological datasets.
