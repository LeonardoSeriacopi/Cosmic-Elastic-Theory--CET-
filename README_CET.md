# 🌌 Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)

The **Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)** proposes a novel framework for describing cosmic evolution, based on the idea that spacetime behaves as a deformable causal brane. Unlike standard ΛCDM cosmology, CET introduces an **elastic response model** where causal coupling weakens below a critical density, leading to observable deviations without invoking dark energy.

## ⚙️ Theoretical Foundation

At the heart of CET is a **nonlinear elastic tension function** `T(ρ)`, which dictates the causal rigidity of spacetime based on local matter density:

- **High density** regions remain fully coupled and evolve under standard metric expansion.
- **Low density** (void-like) regions undergo **causal decoupling**, producing apparent stretching and frequency distortions.
- The theory defines a critical threshold `Pcrit`, determining the transition between rigid and elastic phases.

Key mathematical structures:
- **Elastic tension equation:** governs the brane’s rigidity.
- **Operators D and D′:** describe density evolution under causal and conformal constraints.
- **Redshift modification term ξ(ρ):** adds a local elastic component to the photon redshift.

## 🔬 Scientific Scope

CET provides new tools for interpreting:
- Apparent cosmic acceleration (without Λ),
- Redshift drift and luminosity distance distortions,
- Void morphology and light propagation in underdense regions.

Validation efforts are structured in modular experiments:
- **Density diagnostics** using synthetic and real void data;
- **Elastic operator analysis** (D and D′) on Eridanus void;
- **Redshift drift reinterpretation** via elastic frequency shift;
- **Pcrit calibration** and its universality test.
