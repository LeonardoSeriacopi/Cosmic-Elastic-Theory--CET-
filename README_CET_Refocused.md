# Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)

The Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET) proposes a new geometric interpretation of cosmological redshift, framing it as an emergent effect of elastic deformations in the causal structure of spacetime. Rather than attributing redshift exclusively to metric expansion, CET introduces a model in which **light is stretched by differential elastic states** as it traverses regions of varying causal density and tension.

This framework opens an alternative perspective on observational cosmology by:

- Replacing metric expansion with **causal deformation** as the driver of redshift.
- Modeling space as a **brane-like elastic medium**, whose local properties evolve with density.
- Explaining cosmic phenomena (e.g. redshift gradients, luminosity distance drift, void profiles) as emergent features of an **elastic, non-static spacetime**.

CET incorporates a physically grounded saturation mechanism that prevents runaway deformation and introduces thresholds beyond which spacetime detaches from the Hubble flow. This approach aims to reconstruct cosmology from the principle of **causal stretch**, grounded in empirical observables and thermodynamic consistency.

## 🔬 Scientific Scope

- **Elastic redshift:** Reinterpretation of cosmological redshift as an effect of elastic tension gradients.
- **Brane dynamics:** Local density alters the elastic state of the spacetime brane, modifying light paths.
- **Causal thresholds:** Introduces universal transition points like \( \rho_{crit} \) and \( P_{sat} \).
- **Observational interface:** Applied to supernovae, early galaxy sizes, and voids under collapse.
