# Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)

This repository consolidates the theoretical framework, empirical validations, and data analysis pipelines of the **Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)**, a novel approach to cosmology in which redshift is reinterpreted as an elastic deformation of space-time. CET offers an alternative to dark matter and dark energy by introducing causal saturation, elastic tension, and geometric corrections in underdense and overdense cosmic structures.

## 🔬 Scientific Scope

- **Foundational Theory**: Redefines the cosmological redshift as an elastic deformation, based on brane tension \( T(\rho) \), elastic rate \( \alpha(\rho) \), and a causal density limit \( \rho_{\text{sat}} \).
- **Mathematical Framework**: Tensor calculus and saturation dynamics, including equations for pressure, deformation, and causal decoupling.
- **Empirical Validation**:
  - **JADES / CEERS**: High-redshift tests with JWST galaxies
  - **Pantheon+**: Low-redshift calibration from Type Ia supernovae
  - **Voids**: Detection of causal rupture in cosmic voids (e.g. Eridanus)
  - **Clusters**: Gravitational equilibrium of 52,875 DES clusters without dark matter
