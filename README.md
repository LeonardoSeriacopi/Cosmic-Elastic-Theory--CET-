# Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)

This repository consolidates the theoretical framework, empirical validations, and data analysis pipelines of the *Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)*, a novel approach to cosmology in which redshift is reinterpreted as an elastic deformation of space-time. CET offers an alternative to dark matter and dark energy by introducing causal saturation, elastic tension, and geometric corrections in underdense and overdense cosmic structures.

## 🔬 Scientific Scope

- *Foundational Theory*: Reinterprets cosmological redshift as an elastic deformation of space-time, defined by three key quantities: T(rho): the elastic tension as a function of local density / alpha(rho): the deformation rate / rho_sat: the causal density limit that triggers decoupling.
- *Mathematical Framework*: Built on tensor calculus and deformation dynamics, the theory introduces phase transitions between underdense (stretching) and overdense (compression) regimes.
- *Empirical Validation*:
  - High-redshift galaxies cluster (JADES)
  - Elasticity in CEERS galaxies (local mapping)
  - Supernovae and density-dependent redshift deformation  (Pantheon+)
  - Geometric tension behavior in cosmic voids (Eridanus)
  - Cluster stability without dark matter (DES Y3A2) 
  - Redshift-density statistical structure (quasars DR16Q)
  - Phase transition signatures in weak lensing variance (DES Weak Lensing Catalog).

**DES Weak Lensing Catalog:** This analysis inaugurates the second phase of CET's empirical validation, with a new focus on the emergent gravity paradigm. Instead of analyzing redshift corrections in low-density regimes, this test probes the theory's core prediction in high-density environments: that gravity itself is modulated by a thermodynamic phase transition in the spacetime medium. By analyzing the variance of weak lensing convergence (kappa) from the DES catalog, we search for the "smoking gun" signature of this transition—a peak in variance at the theoretically predicted critical pressure.
