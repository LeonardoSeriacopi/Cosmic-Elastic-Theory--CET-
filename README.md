# Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)

This repository consolidates the theoretical framework, empirical validations, and data analysis pipelines of the *Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)*, a novel approach to cosmology in which redshift is reinterpreted as an elastic deformation of space-time. CET offers an alternative to dark matter and dark energy by introducing causal saturation, elastic tension, and geometric corrections in underdense and overdense cosmic structures.

## 🔬 Scientific Scope

- *Foundational Theory*: Reinterprets cosmological redshift as an elastic deformation of space-time, defined by three key quantities: T(rho): the elastic tension as a function of local density / alpha(rho): the deformation rate / rho_sat: the causal density limit that triggers decoupling.
- *Mathematical Framework*: Built on tensor calculus and deformation dynamics, the theory introduces phase transitions between underdense (stretching) and overdense (compression) regimes.
- *Empirical Validation*:
  - High-redshift galaxies cluster (JADES)
  - Elasticity in CEERS galaxies (local mapping)
  - Supernovae and density-dependent redshift deformation  (Pantheon+)
  - Geometric tension behavior in cosmic voids (Eridanus)
  - Cluster stability without dark matter (DES Y3A2) 
  - Redshift-density statistical structure (quasars DR16Q)
