# Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)

This repository consolidates the theoretical framework, empirical validations, and data analysis pipelines of the *Cosmic Elastic Theory (CET)*, a novel approach to cosmology in which redshift is reinterpreted as an elastic deformation of space-time. CET offers an alternative to dark matter and dark energy by introducing causal saturation, elastic tension, and geometric corrections in underdense and overdense cosmic structures.

## 🔬 Scientific Scope

- *Foundational Theory*: Redefines the cosmological redshift as an elastic deformation, based on brane tension \( T(\rho) \), elastic rate \( \alpha(\rho) \), and a causal density limit \( \rho_{\text{sat}} \).
- *Mathematical Framework*: Tensor calculus and saturation dynamics, including equations for pressure \( P_{\text{crit}} \), deformation, and causal decoupling.
- *Empirical Validation*:
  - High-redshift galaxies cluster (JADES)
  - Elasticity in CEERS galaxies (local mapping)
  - Supernovae and density-dependent redshift deformation  (Pantheon+)
  - Geometric tension behavior in cosmic voids (Eridanus)
  - Cluster stability without dark matter (DES Y3A2) 
  - Redshift-density statistical structure (quasars DR16Q)
